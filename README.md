With passion and 6+ years experience of working in the Information Technology, Solutions Architect and Services Industry, I always try to make great products. I work with care in mind: care about Solution Architecture, User Experience, Code Quality. I also made scalable, reliable products that improve business operations. In my free time, I'm always tinkering with Linux systems, experimenting with Ollama for AI projects, diving deep into networking concepts, and running my own self-hosted services at home. Clients love working with me because I deliver solid, innovative solutions while being a supportive teammate who enjoys tackling complex challenges.
